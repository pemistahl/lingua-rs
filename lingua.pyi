        By default, Lingua returns the most likely language for a given
        input text. However, there are certain words that are spelled the
        same in more than one language. The word 'prologue', for instance,
        is both a valid English and French word. Lingua would output either
        English or French which might be wrong in the given context.
        For cases like that, it is possible to specify a minimum relative
        distance that the logarithmized and summed up probabilities for
        each possible language have to satisfy.

        Be aware that the distance between the language probabilities is
        dependent on the length of the input text. The longer the input
        text, the larger the distance between the languages. So if you
        want to classify very short text phrases, do not set the minimum
        relative distance too high. Otherwise you will get most results
        returned as None which is the return value for cases where
        language detection is not reliably possible.

        filter engine. For web services, for instance, it is rather
        beneficial to preload all language models into memory to avoid

        feasible for systems running low on resources.

        This method disables the high accuracy mode so that only a small
        subset of language models is loaded into memory. The downside of
        this approach is that detection accuracy for short texts consisting
        of less than 120 characters will drop significantly. However,
        detection accuracy for texts which are longer than 120 characters
